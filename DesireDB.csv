Why make a wet chamois leather flogger I have only been flogged with one of these once but it was a very special experience and I have wanted to own one ever since.,"What is a wet chamois leather flogger True chamois leather comes from the chamois goat, is hard to find and expensive. The chamois leather that I am talking about is the lambskin kind, cured with fish oil, that we are all familiar with, that is used for washing cars and windows. Once this leather has been put in water it becomes stiff when it dries and can only be used after it is soaked. A flogger made from this and used wet is a massively thuddy toy that has the greater intensity that any water adds to a spanking combined with a rapid cooling effect after the stroke because it leaves the impact site wet.","I have never seen one for sale and the one that I was flogged with was home made (very roughly, chamois cut and nailed onto a bit of wood but it worked well). So the only option is to make my own. One I found on the web having searched the internet I did find plenty of chamois leather floggers but they where very expensive and not designed to be used wet. The only one that I found that was meant to be used wet is the one pictured above,that came from this SITE.

I'm not using a beta for this, nothing against anyone I just don't to seem to have one anymore. Disclaimer this story is totally stolen/rewritten from a romance novel titled Lord of the storm, it was written by Justine Davis, published back in July of 1994. It is a sci-fi romance novel I have read at least 20 times over in high school; and it is still to this day one of my favorite au romance novels; that I read when I want to relax, and be welcomed into a familiar world by old friends. I figured since we have rewritten movies, I'm sure we can rewrite books as well, I'm just adding in the boys and altering it to suit them best.","I make no money from this fiction, I own nothing... god that is so the truth.

I evaluated my situation and tried to decide whether I [wanted to] change the flat on the spot or just walk the last mile and fix it having the convenience of a full-size rather than a mini pump.,"The most recent event took place this last Sunday. Riding again on Ridgewood Rd. I got a flat as I turned off of Tunxis and rode through the light. The standard initial denial raced through my brain as I felt the reduced resistance in my rear tire but after a couple more pedal strokes I looked down to see my sad deflated rear tire. I hopped off the bike cursing the worst POS tires I have ever owned (Panaracer Paselas, 5 flats in less than 6 mos.).","Possessing only one spare tube and envisioning either fixing the flat then pinching the tube while putting the last inches of the tire bead back on the rim, or failing to remove the invader which caused the problem in the first place and popping the new tube, or most likely, just out of sheer laziness I decided to walk. This entailed throwing the bike over my shoulder as to not further compromise my already crappy tires (no comfortable feat keeping in mid that my commuter bike is not a flyweight fixie or my Panasonic single-speed, but rather a 40 lb steel behemoth fully equipped with gears, rack, and fenders). After 10 minutes or so my shoulder began to hurt and I realized that the straight shot down Ridgewood that takes no more than 5 minutes to zip down on the bicycle would be a long and uncomfortable walk under it.",Unfulfilled,2,I decided to walk.

Poses that incorporate the half or full lotus cross-legged position, or those such as the revolved side angle pose, where the knee is bent and rotated and taking some of the body's weight, are particularly hard on knees. In addition to the knee, injuries to the back and wrists are also common in yoga.

There are two key entities: The rules themselves and the facts that the rules work on. The rules themselves can infer new facts from the facts that they are given which can lead to further rules being fired. This ""inference engine"" approach is amazingly powerful and the ""chaining"" of rules can lead to very powerful results with just a few simple rules.",JBoss rules (Drools) (http/labs.jboss.com/drools/) Oracle Rules (http/ww.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/business_rules/index.html) Each of these platforms essentially offer the same general problem solving approach using inference engines and the ability to seperate business logic from coding.

Never mind that Republicans must take responsibility for the fact that real wages have fallen for the last 30 years, except during the Clinton administration, for all but the top 5% of earners even though Americans of all stripes have never been more productive and that our healthcare system has lead record numbers of workers into bankruptcy or without basic healthcare.
